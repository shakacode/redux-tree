Alternative way to compose Redux reducers.

## State as a Tree
Application state is a `tree`. It can be described as a combination of `branches` and `leaves`. Branch doesn't hold any state itself, but groups the leaves. Each leaf holds the part of the application state. E.g., branch `state.entities` holds the state of `posts` leaf, `comments` leaf etc.

```
state:
  entities:
    posts: { index, entities }
    comments: { entities }
  ui:
    postsList: { processingPosts: Array<Id> }
    postView: { ... }
```

When user interacts with UI -> application changes its state. Let's say user manages his posts and removes one of them by clicking the "Delete" button. What's happening under the hood: app starts request to the server and adds `postId` to the `processingPosts` set to show the spinner in the UI. It requires a change in the single `postsList` leaf of the state tree:

```js
// Request action dispatch
dispatch({
  type: 'POST_DELETE_REQUESTED',
  postId,
})

// Action handler: reduces the state of the single leaf
POST_DELETE_REQUESTED:
  (state, { postId }) =>
    state.update('processingPosts', processingPosts => processingPosts.add(postId))
```

When server responds with the success, `postId` must be removed from the `processingPosts` set and post entity must be removed from the `entities.posts` leaf. This action requires the changes of the 2 different leaves:

```js
// Success action dispatch
dispatch({
  type: 'POST_DELETE_SUCCEEDED',
  postId,
})

// Passing array of handlers for this action type
// to define sequence of the changes in the state tree
POST_DELETE_SUCCEEDED: [
  // 1. hiding spinner
  (state, { postId }) =>
    state.update('processingPosts', processingPosts => processingPosts.delete(postId)),

  // 2. removing post entity
  {
    leaf: ['entities', 'posts'], // <= keypath to the leaf
    reduce:
      (postsEntitiesState, { postId }) =>
        postsEntitiesState
          .updateIn(['index'], index => index.delete(postId))
          .updateIn(['entities'], entities => entities.delete(postId)),
  },
]
```

To make this code work, few changes required in how Redux iterates over the reducers. Instead of tightly couple each reducer to the single leaf, letâ€™s let the leaf decide which part(s) of state will be updated in the response to the action. This is what `redux-tree` does.

## Implementation details
`redux-tree` is an alternative version of Redux's `combineReducers` method. It allows declaring the changes in the state, caused by the action, as a sequence of functions.

`redux-tree` represents the state as an Immutable `Record` to handle deep updates and to prevent state mutations. [`immutable-js`](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) is required.

Packages from Redux eco system should be compatible with it as the only change it introduces is how Redux _internally_ iterates over the reducers.

## Installation

```shell
# yarn / npm
yarn add redux-tree
npm install --save redux-tree

# don't forget to install redux & immutable
yarn add redux immutable
npm install --save redux immutable
```

## Example

[Sources](./example/src/app) &middot; [Live](http://redux-tree.surge.sh)

Check out [this medium post](https://blog.shakacode.com/a-year-of-development-with-redux-part-iii-7a0e9a7d7670) on structuring of the Redux app. This library is a direct continuation of the ideas I stated there as it lets declare interactions in even more concise manner.

## Usage
`redux-tree` exposes 3 modules:

### `createTree`

```js
const tree = createTree({
  auth: authLeaf,
  entities: entitiesBranch,
  ui: uiBranch,
});

type Tree = (state: State, action: Action) => State;
type CreateTree = ({ [key: string]: Branch | Leaf }) => Tree;

// Then pass it to redux's `createStore` instead of reducer
const store = createStore(tree, initialState, enhancers);
```

`createTree` receives 1 argument: object with branches and/or leaves. Returns a `tree`, in fact this is a root reducer.

### `createBranch`

```js
const branch = createBranch({
  posts: postsLeaf,
  comments: commentsLeaf,
})

type CreateBranch = ({ [key: string]: Branch | Leaf }) => Branch;
```

`createBranch` also receives 1 argument: object with branches and/or leaves. You don't need this method if your state tree is 1 level deep. Returns a `branch`.

### `createLeaf`

```js
const leaf = createLeaf(initialState, actionHandlers);
const leaf = createLeaf(reducer);

type CreateLeaf =
  | (initialState: LeafState, actionHandlers?: ActionHandlers) => Leaf
  | (reducer: Reducer) => Leaf
;
```

You can pass 2 types of arguments to `createLeaf`:

1. Single argument: classic reducer function, which takes state of the leaf and action and returns next leaf state.
2. Two arguments: initial state of the leaf and object with action handlers.

#### Action handlers

Action handlers are stored in an object. Its keys are action types, and values are action handlers (reducers). You can define reducers in the following ways:

**As a function**. It receives the state of the leaf to which it was initially passed and dispatched action. Must return a state of the leaf.

```js
{ ACTION_TYPE: (state, action) => state }
```

**As an object** with:
* `leaf`: keypath to the leaf in the state
* `reduce`: reducer, which receives state of the leaf at provided keypath and dispatched action.

```js
{
  ACTION_TYPE: {
    leaf: ['path', 'to', 'leaf'],
    reduce: (state, action) => state,
  },
}
```

**As an array** of the previous two. Useful when you need to change the state of the multiple leaves in response to single action.

```js
{
  ACTION_TYPE: [
    (state, action) => state, // function receives state of the local leaf

    {
      leaf: ['path', 'to', 'leaf'],
      reduce: (state, action) => state, // receives the state of the leaf at the keypath
    },
  ],
}
```
